    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A fantastic way to pep up chicken, pack it with flavour and ensure it's nice and juicy.</p>
    <p>These skewers are a great option when you know you're going to be in a rush come dinner time. You can make up the kebabs ahead of time and keep them in the fridge till later. Then grill them about 10-15 minutes before you're ready to eat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Chicken breasts</li>
        <li>120g greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced ginger</li>
        <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken breast pieces into a bowl or freezer bag with the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, coriander, turmeric, cumin, paprika, chilli powder, cinnamon, salt and pepper.  </li>
        <li>Mix together so that everything is combined, then cover and place in the fridge to marinate for 2-3 hours. </li>
        <li>If youâ€™re using wooden skewers, place them in water to soak while the chicken is marinating. This will help to prevent them burning during grilling. </li>
        <li>Remove the marinated chicken from the fridge and thread onto skewers.</li>
        <li>Brush the chicken with the oil, then place on a griddle plate and cook, turning a couple of times, for 8-10 minutes until cooked through. Alternatively, you can grill (broil) under a grill, or you can barbecue for the same amount of time.</li>
        <li>Make sure the chicken is cooked by slicing into a larger piece and ensuring it's no longer pink in the middle.</li>
    </ol>
